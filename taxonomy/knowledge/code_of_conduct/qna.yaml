      ## Do Your Part

      Think before you act.  Use good judgment.  Ask for help when the answer is not clear. Promptly speak up if you see or suspect misconduct - speaking up is not always easy, but it's always the right thing to do.

      To protect Citi's reputation for integrity, you must:
      - · Understand: Understand and comply with the laws, regulations, and Citi policies, standards, and procedures that govern your business, region, and/or function.
      - · Uphold Our Values: Act in accordance with the values and principles expressed in our Mission and Value Proposition, our Leadership Principles, and this Code and apply them every day, to everything you do, and in every decision you make.

      - · Be Accountable: Take responsibility for your decisions and actions and hold others accountable.
      - · Be Respectful: Treat others with respect and take immediate action when you observe any inappropriate conduct towards clients, colleagues, or third parties.
      - · Speak Up: Immediately report unacceptable conduct.
      - · Cooperate: Fully cooperate with any investigation and be truthful and forthcoming during such investigations.

      ## Managers' Responsibilities

      We expect all employees to be leaders, but recognize that our managers in particular are role models who must lead by example and inspire their teams to live our values.

      As role models, managers must:
      - · Reinforce: Regularly reinforce the importance of understanding and following our Mission and Value Proposition, Leadership Principles, and this Code, and the policies and procedures that apply to their team members' daily job responsibilities.
      - · Set Expectations: Ensure that employees understand that business results are never more important than acting with integrity. Understand the risks inherent in their team members' work, and play an active role in assuring the quality of that work.
      - · Encourage: Encourage employees to speak up and raise concerns, especially about potential legal or ethical issues, and foster a work environment where they feel comfortable doing so.

      ## Escalating Concerns

      Acting ethically is not only the right thing to do but also the right way to do business and best serve our clients, colleagues, shareholders, and communities.

      If you have any question as to whether a particular situation requires escalation, you should always choose to escalate.

      We are all required to report concerns about conduct or situations that may put our company or our customers at risk. The early identification and resolution of issues is critical to maintaining the trust of our clients, business colleagues, employees, and stakeholders.

      If you have reason to believe that any Citi employee, or anyone working on Citi's behalf, may have engaged in misconduct, which includes violations or potential violations of law, regulation, rule, or breaches of policy, standard, procedure, or thisCode, including threats or acts of physical violence, you must promptly escalate your concerns to any of the following:

      - · Your manager or another member of management
      - · Your Human Resources (HR), Employee Relations, or Labor Relations representative
      - · Citi Security and Investigative Services (CSIS)
      - · Your Independent Compliance Risk Management (ICRM) Officer
      - · Your business unit or function's internal legal counsel
      - · The Citi Ethics Office

      Just as you will be held accountable for your own actions, you may also be held accountable for a failure to escalate the actions of others if you knew that they were in violation of law, regulation, or rule, or in breach of policy, standard, procedure, or this Code.

      While we encourage you to raise issues to Citi first, we appreciate that this is not always possible.  Nothing in the Code prohibits you from communicating with government, regulatory, or self-regulatory agencies about possible concerns, or otherwise providing information to, filing a complaint with, or participating in investigations or proceedings with those agencies.  Nor does the Code require you to notify Citi of any such communications.

We do not tolerate discrimination, harassment, retaliation, or intimidation of any kind that breaches our policies or is unlawful, whether committed by or against a manager, co-worker, client, supplier, or visitor and whether it occurs while at work, at work-related events, or outside of work.
      We believe that our employees are entitled to a safe and healthy working environment: one in which personal talent and merit are recognized, diversity is valued, privacy is respected, and employees are supported as they balance professional and personal life.
