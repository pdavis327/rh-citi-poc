## A Message from Citi's CEO

## Trust is the foundation of every relationship we build.

Our clients, colleagues, regulators and shareholders all trust us and depend on us to act with integrity and always do the right thing, even when it is hard.

Our Code of Conduct is our guide to ethical behavior. No matter what your role is at the firm, you are responsible for understanding it and abiding by it.

This means taking action if you feel something is not right. It means immediately intervening by speaking up if you see or suspect inappropriate behavior.

It also means ensuring your own daily decisions stay true to our Mission and Value Proposition and are in our clients' interests, create economic value and are systemically responsible.

Our success as a firm relies on our collective accountability. Just one crack in the foundation of trust can undermine our ability to deliver for each other and our clients. We each have a role at Citi, and we must hold ourselves and each other accountable in our daily work to achieve our goals. As you do so, know that we prohibit any form of retaliatory action against anyone who raises concerns about actual or potential wrongdoing.

Thank you for taking the time to review the Code of Conduct and please continue taking ownership and challenging each other to achieve a higher standard of excellence in everything we do.

Thank you,

Jane

## Citi's Value Proposition: A Mission of Growth and Enabling Progress

Citi's mission is to serve as a trusted partner to our clients by responsibly providing financial services that enable growth and economic progress. Our core activities are safeguarding assets, lending money, making payments, and accessing the capital markets on behalf of our clients. We have more than 200 years of experience helping our clients meet the world's toughest challenges and embrace its greatest opportunities. We are Citi, the global bank an institution connecting millions of people across hundreds of countries and cities.

We protect people's savings and help them make the purchases - from everyday transactions to buying a home - that improve the quality of their lives. We advise people on how to invest for future needs, such as their children's education and their own retirement, and help them buy securities such as stocks and bonds.

We work with companies to optimize their daily operations, whether they need working capital, to make payroll, or export their goods overseas. By lending to companies large and small, we help them grow, creating jobs and real economic value at home and in communities around the world. We provide financing and support to governments at all levels, so they can build sustainable infrastructure, such as housing, transportation, schools, and other vital public works.

These capabilities create an obligation to act responsibly, do everything possible to create the best outcomes, and prudently manage risk. If we fall short, we will take decisive action and learn from our experience.

We strive to earn and maintain the public's trust by constantly adhering to the highest ethical standards. We ask our colleagues to ensure that their decisions pass three tests: they are in our clients' interests, create economic value, and are always systemically responsible. When we do these things well, we make a positive financial and social impact in the communities we serve and show what a global bank can do.

## Living Our Values

The Code has been adopted by the Board of Directors of Citigroup Inc. ('Citi') and applies to every director, officer, and employee of Citigroup Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including Citibank, N.A. We are all required to read and comply with this Code, regardless of the country in which we live and work, because Citi's commitment to conducting business according to the highest standards of ethical conduct transcends national boundaries. Other persons performing services for Citi also may be subject to this Code by contract or other agreement. The Code is available in multiple languages on Citigroup's Investor Relations site.

The Code is not a contract of employment and it does not convey any specific employment rights or guarantee employment for any specific time.

Our Code outlines our commitment to integrity in all aspects of our business and is an important resource to help us to make decisions and take actions consistent with what we strive for - excellence every day.

Our Code of Conduct is our guide to doing the right thing and applies to everyone at Citi.

## Everyone's Responsibilities

We share a common responsibility to hold ourselves to the highest standards of ethics and professional behavior in dealing with our clients, business colleagues, shareholders, communities, and each other.

<!-- image -->

## Do Your Part

Think before you act.  Use good judgment.  Ask for help when the answer is not clear. Promptly speak up if you see or suspect misconduct - speaking up is not always easy, but it's always the right thing to do.

To protect Citi's reputation for integrity, you must:

- · Understand: Understand and comply with the laws, regulations, and Citi policies, standards, and procedures that govern your business, region, and/or function.
- · Uphold Our Values: Act in accordance with the values and principles expressed in our Mission and Value Proposition, our Leadership Principles, and this Code and apply them every day, to everything you do, and in every decision you make.
- · Be Honest: Conduct business in a manner that is fair, transparent, prudent, and dependable. This includes a commitment to honesty in our dealings and communications with our clients, suppliers, competitors, and each other.
- · Be Accountable: Take responsibility for your decisions and actions and hold others accountable.
- · Be Respectful: Treat others with respect and take immediate action when you observe any inappropriate conduct towards clients, colleagues, or third parties.
- · Speak Up: Immediately report unacceptable conduct.
- · Cooperate: Fully cooperate with any investigation and be truthful and forthcoming during such investigations.

## Managers' Responsibilities

We expect all employees to be leaders, but recognize that our managers in particular are role models who must lead by example and inspire their teams to live our values.

As role models, managers must:

- · Reinforce: Regularly reinforce the importance of understanding and following our Mission and Value Proposition, Leadership Principles, and this Code, and the policies and procedures that apply to their team members' daily job responsibilities.
- · Set Expectations: Ensure that employees understand that business results are never more important than acting with integrity. Understand the risks inherent in their team members' work, and play an active role in assuring the quality of that work.
- · Encourage: Encourage employees to speak up and raise concerns, especially about potential legal or ethical issues, and foster a work environment where they feel comfortable doing so.
- · Listen: Listen to employees who raise concerns and take their concerns seriously.
- · Escalate: Ensure all concerns are properly resolved or promptly escalated through appropriate channels.
- · Educate: Promote awareness of all resources available for seeking advice or reporting concerns, including the Ethics Hotline.
- · Never Retaliate: Not engage in or tolerate retaliation of any kind and clearly communicate Citi's prohibition of workplace retaliation.
- · Recognize: Recognize team members who act in accordance with our values when evaluating and rewarding employees.

## Do Your Part

## Learn More

<!-- image -->

Lead by example, empower others, and make yourself approachable. As a manager, if you are approached with a question or concern, listen carefully, give your colleague your complete attention, and ask for clarification of anything you do not understand.  Immediately address concerns within your area of direct responsibility; promptly escalate all other concerns to the appropriate Citi resource.

## Our Decisions

This Code cannot specifically address every situation, and we rely on you to exercise your judgment consistent with our Mission and Value Proposition, Leadership Principles, and this Code.  How we make a decision says as much about who we are as a company as the decision itself.

Does it comply with the law, regulation, Citi policies, and our Code of Conduct?

Making good decisions isn't always easy.  Competing interests, workplace changes, approaching deadlines, outside distractions, and improper rationalizations can make good decision-making a challenge. It is in these moments that you should ask yourself:

We consider both the letter and spirit of each and put our values into action.

Would it cause harm to Citi's reputation or your reputation?

<!-- image -->

We take actions based on a thorough understanding of the risks involved and act with due care, diligence, and skill.

Would it result in even the appearance of a conflict of interest or impropriety?

We avoid situations where personal interests are, or appear to be, in opposition to Citi's interests or the interests of our clients.

Would you feel comfortable if it was made public?

We are fair, honest, transparent, and accountable for our actions.

Do you have enough information, or do you need guidance?

<!-- image -->

Making ethical decisions also means you are responsible for seeking advice when needed.

In general, when there is a difference between Citi policies that apply to you and the laws of the jurisdictions in which you conduct business, the more restrictive requirement will prevail. If your business, region, or function has policies that are more restrictive than this Code, follow the more restrictive policies. Citi policies, standards, and procedures provide more information about topics in this Code. Guidance can be found on the Citi Policy Directory and your business intranet site. Just as industry standards and legal and regulatory requirements evolve, Citi policies, standards, and procedures are amended from time to time.

If you have questions or concerns about how this Code, Citi's Mission and Value Proposition, Citi policies, or local laws apply to your actions or those of others, see the Speaking Up and Seeking Help section.

You are responsible for your decisions. No one, at any level, has the authority to tell you to do something illegal or unethical.

## Escalating Concerns

Acting ethically is not only the right thing to do but also the right way to do business and best serve our clients, colleagues, shareholders, and communities.

If you have any question as to whether a particular situation requires escalation, you should always choose to escalate.

We are all required to report concerns about conduct or situations that may put our company or our customers at risk. The early identification and resolution of issues is critical to maintaining the trust of our clients, business colleagues, employees, and stakeholders.

If you have reason to believe that any Citi employee, or anyone working on Citi's behalf, may have engaged in misconduct, which includes violations or potential violations of law, regulation, rule, or breaches of policy, standard, procedure, or thisCode, including threats or acts of physical violence, you must promptly escalate your concerns to any of the following:

- · Your manager or another member of management
- · Your Human Resources (HR), Employee Relations, or Labor Relations representative
- · Citi Security and Investigative Services (CSIS)
- · Your Independent Compliance Risk Management (ICRM) Officer
- · Your business unit or function's internal legal counsel
- · The Citi Ethics Office

Just as you will be held accountable for your own actions, you may also be held accountable for a failure to escalate the actions of others if you knew that they were in violation of law, regulation, or rule, or in breach of policy, standard, procedure, or this Code.

While we encourage you to raise issues to Citi first, we appreciate that this is not always possible.  Nothing in the Code prohibits you from communicating with government, regulatory, or self-regulatory agencies about possible concerns, or otherwise providing information to, filing a complaint with, or participating in investigations or proceedings with those agencies.  Nor does the Code require you to notify Citi of any such communications.

<!-- image -->

## Stay Alert

Have a question, problem, or concern?   In most cases, your manager should be your first point of contact.  Your manager is likely in the best position to understand your concern and take the appropriate action.  If you feel uncomfortable addressing your concerns with your manager for any reason, or if your concerns relate to your manager, you can always use any of the other resources previously listed.

## Reporting to the Citi Ethics Office

You may report your concern to the Citi Ethics Office , located in the U.S., by:

<!-- image -->

Reporting online through website submission at: http://www.citigroup.com/citi/investor/ethics\_hotline.html

<!-- image -->

Calling the Citi Ethics Hotline (available 24/7 in multiple languages) by:

- · Looking up the dialing options available in your location in the Country Dialing Instructions;
- · Dialing 1-866-ETHIC-99 (1-866-384-4299); or
- · Dialing 1-212-559-5842 (direct or collect)

Calls may result in charges from your carrier. Please check with your carrier before dialing.

Reports to the Ethics Office about human resources-related matters are forwarded to Human Resources and Employee Relations for review and follow-up.

<!-- image -->

## Anonymity and Confidentiality

## Prohibition of Workplace Retaliation

Citi believes it is essential that you feel secure when raising a concern, and we encourage you to communicate your concerns openly.

All contacts to the Ethics Office and Ethics Office investigations are treated as confidentially as possible, consistent with the need to investigate and address the matter, and subject to applicable laws and regulations.

When submitting a concern, please provide as much detailed information as possible. Including specific information, such as the business or function, location, individuals, transactions, events, and dates involved, enables a more effective investigation.

Concerns to the Ethics Office may be made anonymously via the Citi Ethics Hotline. If you wish to report anonymously, please do not provide your name or other identifying information when submitting your concern. However, you must understand that if you do choose to remain anonymous and do not provide a means to contact you, Citi may be unable to obtain the additional information needed to investigate or address your concern.

If you raise an ethical issue and you do not believe it has been addressed, you should raise it with any of the other contacts listed in this Code.

Citi prohibits any form of retaliatory action against anyone who raises concerns or questions regarding ethics, discrimination, or harassment matters; requests a reasonable accommodation for a disability, pregnancy, or religious belief; reports suspected violations of law, regulation, rule, or breach of policy, standard, procedure, or this Code; or participates in a subsequent investigation of such concerns.

Retaliation is a serious issue and includes any adverse action taken because an employee has engaged in such activity. As part of any investigation, we respect the rights that are afforded under applicable laws and regulations to all parties related to the matter.

Employees who engage in retaliation - or discourage a colleague from raising concerns - are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or other relationship with Citi.

Do Your Part

We know it takes courage to come forward, but we are all required to speak up, so Citi takes its responsibility to prevent retaliation very seriously.

## Reviews and Investigations

When concerns are raised about possible misconduct or unethical behavior, Citi conducts reviews and investigations thoroughly, fairly, with discretion, and in a timely manner, regardless of the people involved.

If you are asked to participate in an appropriately authorized internal or external review or investigation, you must:

- · Cooperate fully.
- · Provide accurate and comprehensive information. Do not withhold, tamper with, or fail to communicate relevant information, or otherwise interfere with the investigation such as by attempting to persuade other employees to respond in certain ways, or by discouraging anyone from raising a concern.
- · Not make false or misleading statements to internal or external auditors, investigators, legal counsel, Citi representatives, regulators, or other governmental entities.
- · Maintain and safeguard the confidentiality of an investigation to the extent possible, except as otherwise provided by applicable law.

Citi prohibits retaliatory actions against anyone for participating in an appropriately authorized internal or external review or investigation, as set forth in the Prohibition of Workplace Retaliation section.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Disciplinary Action

You are personally responsible for your conduct, including improper or illegal acts or misconduct committed by you during your relationship with Citi.

Abiding by the standards outlined in this Code and related policies is a condition of continued employment with Citi. Violations of law, regulation, rule, or breaches of policy, standard, procedure, or this Code may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment or other relationship with Citi. They may also be reported to regulators and can result in civil or criminal penalties, cancellation or clawback of deferred awards, disqualification from serving in certain capacities, and a permanent bar from employment in the financial services industry.

Furthermore, Citi's Global Disciplinary Review Policy and Accountability Framework promote consistent employee treatment in disciplinary actions arising from misconduct during the year-end performance and compensation process.  If you receive disciplinary action arising from misconduct during the performance year that does not result in the termination of your employment, it will be reflected in your year-end performance appraisal and may result in a negative impact to compensation as set forth in the Accountability Framework.

## Repayment of Legal Expenses

If you expect to pay legal expenses to defend yourself in a civil or criminal action, suit, or proceeding arising from your service as an officer, director, or employee of Citi, you may ask Citi to provide counsel to represent you.

If management determines that you are entitled to representation, and for any reason a Citi-designated attorney cannot represent you (e.g., if there is a conflict of interest), Citi may advance fees and expenses for outside counsel hired to represent you. By making the request, you agree that you will repay all these expenses to Citi if it is ultimately determined that you are not entitled to indemnification. The determination of whether you were entitled to indemnification may be made by the board of directors of the Citi entity that advanced the expenses.

## Waivers

To the extent that exemptions are available from Citi policies, they are detailed in the specific policy, together with the exemption process.

Waivers related to other provisions of this Code may be granted only by the General Counsel or the Chief Compliance Officer of Citigroup Inc. Any waiver of this Code for an executive officer or a member of a board of directors of Citigroup Inc. may be made only by a documented decision of the Citigroup Inc. Board of Directors or a Board Committee and must be disclosed publicly within four business days of the decision.

Do Your Part

Treat everyone how you would like to be treated with respect and dignity.

## Did You Know

## Harassment can be:

- · What we say or write to another colleague, using Citi systems or on social media, including unwelcome jokes, derogatory or crude comments, teasing, bullying, or using threatening or abusive language.
- · What we do , whether obvious or subtle, including unwelcome touching or sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal or nonverbal behavior or physical contact that unreasonably interferes with work performance, or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment.
- · What we display , such as placing photos or materials that others may consider discriminatory, offensive, defamatory, pornographic, or sexually suggestive in the work environment.

Harassment is strictly prohibited whether between members of the same or opposite gender, and whether committed in or outside of Citi locations, including employee social events.

## Fostering a Respectful Environment

We achieve our best results in an environment of mutual respect, professionalism, and inclusiveness. We do not tolerate discrimination, harassment, retaliation, or intimidation of any kind that breaches our policies or is unlawful, whether committed by or against a manager, co-worker, client, supplier, or visitor and whether it occurs while at work, at work-related events, or outside of work.

We believe that our employees are entitled to a safe and healthy working environment: one in which personal talent and merit are recognized, diversity is valued, privacy is respected, and employees are supported as they balance professional and personal life.

To promote a respectful work environment, you must:

- · Recognize that every role within Citi is important, as are the people who occupy those roles.
- · Use care in your interactions and never use behavior that is harassing, threatening, bullying, retaliatory, or abusive.
- · Respect the personal beliefs, cultures, identity, and values of every individual. Listen and be respectful of different backgrounds and points of view.
- · Never treat someone differently based on that person's race (including personal appearance and hair), sex, gender, pregnancy, gender identity or expression, color, creed, religion, national origin, nationality, citizenship, age, physical or mental disability or medical condition as defined under applicable law, genetic information, marital status (including domestic partnerships and civil unions as defined and recognized by applicable law), sexual orientation, culture, ancestry, familial or caregiver status, nursing status, military status, veteran's status, socioeconomic status, unemployment status, status as a victim of domestic violence, or any other basis prohibited by law.
- · Familiarize yourself with the concept of unconscious bias and be mindful in the way that you act and behave.
- · Never engage in sexual harassment or other inappropriate behavior. Sexual harassment includes making sexual suggestions to colleagues, commenting on colleagues' sexual lives, making unwanted sexual advances or requests for sexual favors, or discussing inappropriate sexual matters with colleagues either in the workplace or elsewhere. Employees found to have engaged in conduct that constitutes sexual harassment, or any other form of harassment based on a characteristic protected under this Code, or other applicable law or policy, will be subject to immediate termination of employment, as well as cancellation and/or clawback of deferred awards.

- · Take reasonable steps to intervene if you are a bystander and see someone engaging in inappropriate behavior.  The responsibility to intervene applies to all members of Citi's workforce.
- · Never discourage anyone from or retaliate against anyone for reporting harassment, discrimination, or other concerns, or for participating in an investigation of the same.
- · Promptly notify your manager, another member of your management chain, an HR representative, or the Citi Ethics Office if you feel harassed, discriminated against, or retaliated against, or if you witness or receive a report of discriminatory, harassing, or retaliatory behavior. You are not required to report your complaint to anyone who is the subject of the complaint.
- · Positively reflect our culture at social events among colleagues by making them inclusive, business appropriate, and above all, safe.

<!-- image -->

## Always Remember

Managers are uniquely responsible and will be held accountable for:

- · Ensuring a respectful working environment.

We encourage an atmosphere of openness, courage, empathy, and respect, so that all our employees feel free to come forward with their questions, ideas, and concerns.

- · Promptly intervening when they see inappropriate behavior, even if the person is outside of their organization, or more senior than them.
- · Promptly escalating inappropriate behavior they observe or hear about, even if the reporter says they do not want it reported.
- · Ensuring that social activities among employees comply with the Principles for Employee Social Events.

Celebrate individuality.  Act as a community.  We recognize that unique individuals, collaborative teams, and inclusive leaders have farreaching impact and are the engines of new ideas.  We hire and advance people based on their merits and make opportunities for professional development widely available to all members of our workforce.

To help live out our commitment to practice fair employment, embrace diversity, and value inclusion, you must:

- · Create a collaborative work environment where different points of view can be raised and are respected and all team members are encouraged to contribute, develop, and fully use their talents and their voice.
- · Follow equal employment opportunity principles and comply with the letter and spirit of the full range of laws regarding fair employment practices and nondiscrimination.

We best serve our clients when we maintain the skills and knowledge needed to perform our job responsibilities.

To maintain and improve your professional skills, you must:

- · Personally complete required training in a timely manner.

## Keeping Citi Workplaces Safe, Secure, and Healthy

We are committed to the safety and security of our colleagues and the facilities in which we work.

To protect yourself and each other, you must:

- · Not make, commit, or tolerate verbal or physical threats or acts of violence that impact the work environment.
- · Immediately report any verbal or physical threats or acts of violence that impact the work environment, whether toward another person or Citi property, and whether made or committed by managers, colleagues, clients, vendors, visitors, or anyone else.
- · Be alert and not allow unauthorized individuals into secure areas.
- · Not sell, manufacture, distribute, or possess illegal drugs in the workplace or while performing work-related duties.
- · Not carry or possess weapons or firearms (whether licensed or not) in the workplace or while performing work-related duties, unless you are an authorized CSIS staff member.

## Stay Alert

If you have concerns about threats or acts of violence, including domestic violence that impacts the workplace, immediately contact the Regional Citi Security and Investigative Services (CSIS) Command Center for your region.  A complete list of Regional Command Center telephone numbers is available on the Security and Fire Safety Information Hub. Threats or acts of violence will not be tolerated. Any employee who threatens or perpetrates a violent act will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment, civil litigation, and/or criminal prosecution.

If you have questions about how to comply with local and international laws, country or regional health and safety policies, or internal guidelines that have been developed to help maintain secure and healthy conditions in the workplace, contact your manager, HR representative (where applicable), or CSIS.

## Required Employee Reporting

Additional reporting requirements may apply based on your business, region, and/or function. These requirements apply throughout your Citi employment regardless of your job title or level.

## Protecting Information and Privacy

We value the information of our clients, our colleagues, our vendors, our business partners, and our franchise and protect it from unauthorized disclosure or misuse.

When we use other companies to provide services for us, we require them to protect information they may receive about Citi, our clients, colleagues, business partners, and vendors.

## Did You Know

Citi Information includes Personal Information (PI) and Personally Identifiable Information (PII); log-in credentials to access any Citi devices, services, and systems; any Citi or client information classified as Citi internal or higher; as well as Citi intellectual property.

Does Citi own this information or intellectual property?

If Citi-owned, have I received permission to use it?

<!-- image -->

When dealing with Citi confidential information or intellectual property, ask yourself:

With whom may I share it?

If it is shared, could it present risk to Citi or its clients?

Do I have a legitimate business reason to use it, and is that the reason for which it was collected?

Can it be shared outside of the country where it was collected?

<!-- image -->

When dealing with PI or PII, ask yourself:

With whom may I share it?

How do I best protect its confidentiality?

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Always Remember

Access, use, and share Citi information, or that of our clients, colleagues, business partners, and vendors, only for the purpose for which it was collected, only to the extent necessary to perform your assigned job responsibilities, and only share it with authorized persons.

Further, individuals may not be employed in certain positions, departments, and/or functions that create an actual, perceived or potential conflict, which may allow them to intentionally or unintentionally influence, control or affect the terms and conditions of employment of another employee. This also pertains to having a business relationship with a client or vendor - who is a relative, or with whom they are, or have ever been, in a relationship that may cause a conflict of interest in the workplace.

<!-- image -->

## Do Your Part

Understand the specific restrictions that relate to hiring or working with relatives, or someone with whom you have a personal relationship that may cause a conflict of interest in the workplace and follow the Employment of Relatives Policy with respect to employees, as well as nonemployees.

## Gifts and Entertainment

We avoid offering or accepting gifts or entertainment under circumstances that would compromise, or even appear to compromise, our business judgment or inappropriately influence behavior.

The provision or acceptance of reasonable and proportionate gifts, entertainment (including meals), travel, or lodging, given openly and transparently, to promote Citi's image, present products and services, or establish cordial relationships, is generally permissible. Since gifts or entertainment may be restricted or prohibited by applicable law, the offer or receipt of gifts or entertainment must be pre-approved in accordance with Citi's Gifts and Entertainment Standard and other applicable policies and procedures.

Citi employees, their close family members, and anyone acting on Citi's behalf are strictly prohibited from offering, providing, soliciting, accepting, or receiving:

- · Cash, or a cash equivalent.
- · Gifts intended to induce an improper advantage, action, or inaction.
- · Lavish or frequent gifts or entertainment.
- · Anything that could have a negative reputational impact to Citi (for example, anything indecent, sexually explicit, or otherwise inappropriate).
- · Anything that creates an actual or apparent conflict of interest for the recipient.

Never personally pay for business gifts or business entertainment or any portion thereof to circumvent policy thresholds, pre-approval, or other requirements.

<!-- image -->

## Did You Know

A gift is anything of value and can take many forms, including providing travel, lodging, or ground transportation in connection with an event; purchasing a meal or providing hors d'oeuvres at a cocktail party; political contributions; charitable contributions or charitable events; providing training opportunities; hiring an employee or creating an employment opportunity or work experience (including internships, secondments, or job shadows); and providing tickets for events, even courtesy tickets.

It can be difficult to tell whether a gift is appropriate, as laws and customs in different countries vary widely. Whenever you have any questions about the appropriateness of accepting or providing a gift, entertainment, travel, or lodging, consult your manager or the Regional Gifts and Entertainment (G&amp;E) Coordination Unit Contact listed in the Gifts and Entertainment Standard.

Restrictions on Gifts and Entertainment to Restricted Persons

Complex rules govern the giving of gifts, entertainment and other business courtesies to Restricted Persons (which include Government Officials (Non-U.S.), U.S. Public Officials, and U.S. Restricted Persons (Other)).

## Personal Use of Citi Products and Services

Misuse of your Citi personal accounts and banking services may result in the loss of account privileges and additional disciplinary action.  Any misuse of your personal Citi financial products and services, including the improper facilitation of transactions for third parties, raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest and puts us at risk of unwittingly conducting transactions which may be unlawful or contrary to the terms and conditions of the account agreement (e.g., structuring, points gaming, unlicensed money exchange).

## Tied Business Dealings

Communicating to a potential or existing customer that the price or availability of a Citi product or service is predicated upon the potential or existing customer agreeing to purchase from, or provide to, Citi another product or service (a practice known as 'tying') is unlawful in certain instances.

If you have any questions regarding compliance with the tying laws, including their applicability to a particular situation, contact any of those listed in the Anti-Tying Policy for advice.

## Fiduciary Duties

We act as a fiduciary when we act as a trustee or an investment manager, and in certain investment advisory and other client relationships.

A fiduciary has a legal duty to act in the best interests of its client, and put the client's interests ahead of its own interests, the interests of its affiliates or employees, or of any individual or entity other than the client. You must understand when fiduciary duties arise in Citi's business dealings, and Citi's fiduciary governance requirements.

## Antitrust and Fair Competition

We abide by all competition and antitrust laws to help preserve competition in the market; protect consumers from unfair business arrangements; and protect Citi and its reputation.

To ensure fair competition and compliance with applicable laws, you must:

- · Avoid situations that create the potential for unlawful anti-competitive or collusive conduct.
- · Immediately stop any conversation in which a competitor, client, or third party with whom Citi does business, tries to engage in anti-competitive or collusive conduct and contact your manager, Legal, or ICRM.

We also have a responsibility to ensure that all third party activity is conducted in compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations, policies, and Citi's expectations of conduct.

## Insider Trading

Misuse of material nonpublic information erodes our clients' trust and places our license to do business at risk.

Citi policy, and the laws of many countries, prohibit trading in securities of any issuer while in possession of material nonpublic information, also referred to in some jurisdictions more broadly as 'inside information' (together, MNPI) regarding the issuer. It is also illegal in many countries to 'tip' or pass on inside information to any other person who misuses such information by trading in securities or passing such information on further, even if you do not receive any monetary benefit. Trading on or conveying MNPI may also breach contractual obligations assumed by Citi with our clients or on their behalf.

To protect against insider trading, you must:

- · Understand that the prohibition against trading while in possession of MNPI applies to Citi securities, to the securities of other issuers, and to transactions for any Citi account, client account, or personal account.
- · Adhere to information barriers and not use MNPI about Citi or any other company for the purpose of buying or selling Citi's or any other company's securities.
- · Not share MNPI or engage in any form of 'tipping.'
- · Know the restrictions relative to your job. Certain employees have significant restrictions placed on their trading in Citi securities or the securities of other companies.
- · Contact internal legal counsel or your ICRM Officer if you believe you have come into possession of MNPI.

<!-- image -->

Did You Know

Material Nonpublic Information (MNPI)

You should consider information material if a reasonable investor would consider it important when deciding to buy or sell a security, or if the information, if made public, likely would affect the security's market price.

You should consider information nonpublic if it is not generally available to the investing public.

Note that the definition of 'inside information' applicable in various jurisdictions outside of the U.S. is broader. Consult the ICG Material, Nonpublic Information Barrier Policy for additional guidance.

Consequences for insider trading violations can be severe, including termination of employment; civil or criminal penalties for you, and Citi; and irreparable damage to our reputation and public trust.

<!-- image -->

## Information Barriers

We use information barriers to:

- · Prevent confidential information from being shared with individuals who are not authorized to know such information.
- · Address actual or potential conflicts of interest among business activities.

You must know and comply with the information barrier policies applicable to your business, region, and/or function.

Citi recognizes that we must responsibly provide financial services that enable growth and economic progress, make a positive financial and social impact in the global communities that we serve, and combat corruption.

## Anti-Money Laundering (AML)

We are committed to preventing the use of our products or services to launder criminal proceeds, to finance terrorism, or to evade taxation, or to bypass applicable sanctions laws.

Citi Anti-Money Laundering policies are designed to protect customers, our company, and ensure that we comply with reporting and other legal obligations where we operate.

## Did You Know

Money laundering is the process of taking the proceeds of criminal activity and making them appear legitimate or 'clean' by disguising the source, nature, or ownership of the funds so they can be legally accessed or distributed via legitimate financial channels and credible institutions.

Terrorist financing includes the financing of terrorists, terrorist acts, and terrorist organizations and may involve proceeds from both illegitimate and legitimate sources.

Tax evasion refers to the use of illegal schemes to evade lawfully due taxes.

To combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and tax evasion you must:

- · Complete AML training upon employment with Citi and regularly thereafter. If your job responsibilities require more detailed knowledge, complete any additional training assigned to you.
- · Know Your Customer.  Complete all customer due diligence requirements when entering into client relationships and, where applicable, individual transactions. No client relationship is worth compromising our commitment to combating money laundering, terrorist financing, tax evasion, and other crimes.
- · Escalate unusual or suspicious activity according to the procedures of your business, region, and/or function.
- · Never advise a client, or anyone outside of Citi, that an account or transaction is or has been subject to review for AML purposes without first consulting Legal.

## Did You Know

Suspicious-activity reporting is a requirement in the U.S. and most countries in which Citi does business. We are required to identify and report to government authorities any suspicious activity, such as suspicious accounts, transactions, attempted transactions, attempted account openings, attempted circumvention of applicable sanctions restrictions, or other activity that may be related to possible violations of law, such as money laundering, terrorist financing, tax evasion, insider trading and insider abuse, fraud, or the misappropriation of funds.

Sharing or 'tipping off' that a suspicious activity report was filed with people outside of Citi, and in some cases even outside of the AML team within Citi, may be considered a crime in many jurisdictions. If in doubt as to whether the information can be shared, consult with Legal.

## Anti-Bribery

We prohibit any form of corruption in our business dealings.  You must not pay bribes to, or accept bribes from, anyone, anywhere, for any reason.

Citi businesses, legal vehicles, and employees are subject to the Citi Anti-Bribery Policy and the antibribery laws of the countries in which they operate, some of which may have extraterritorial effect.

To prevent bribery, you must:

- · Adhere to all Citi pre-approval and reporting requirements regarding applicable anti-bribery laws.
- · Not give, offer, promise, provide, or agree to provide anything of value, even at an employee's or third party's own expense, to any person, or to induce another person to do the same, if doing so would be, or would be reasonably perceived to be, corrupt, inappropriate, or prohibited under applicable law.
- · Avoid conduct that would constitute bribery - or the receipt, request, or acceptance of a bribe, or the inducement of another person to do the same - or would give the appearance of an attempt, agreement, or inducement to use inappropriate influence with a Restricted Person.
- · Understand that payments made indirectly through an attorney, consultant, broker, contractor, or other third party are subject to the same restrictions. It is your obligation to understand what such a party is doing on your behalf.
- · Conduct appropriate due diligence on external third party relationships.

## Did You Know

## Restricted Persons include:

Government officials (Non-U.S.) include, but are not limited to, any person employed by or representing a government, officials of a political party, officials of public international organizations, candidates for office, and employees of state-owned enterprises.

U.S. Public Officials are any persons holding either elected or appointed office at the U.S. federal, state, or local level, and their staff, or any persons employed by a government entity. This includes officials, directors, and employees of regulatory organizations, agencies, authorities, commissions and boards, public employees' pension funds, and educational institutions that are established or operated by a government entity.

In many jurisdictions, the definition includes family members of the official or employee.  If you have any questions, contact *ICRM USPA Political Activities.

U.S. Restricted Person (Other) include Credit Rating Agency Personnel, Employees of Exchanges, Employees of Regulators, Private Pension Plan Fiduciaries, and Union and Union Officials.

For information about the designations described above, or other questions about the application of the Citi Anti-Bribery Policy, consult the regional AntiBribery Approver listed in Appendix A of the Citi Anti-Bribery Policy.

## Did You Know

What constitutes anything of value is not always obvious. Anything of value includes not only cash, but also gifts, hospitality (travel, meals, and entertainment), charitable donations and charitable events, offers of employment or work experience (including internships, secondments, and job shadows). Anything that has a value could be, or could be perceived to be, a bribe if offered in exchange for any decision or favorable treatment.

## Facilitation payments are

typically small payments made to government officials or agencies to expedite or secure performance of a nondiscretionary, routine governmental action, such as the approval of permits or licenses, or to prompt performance of other lowlevel ministerial duties. The Citi AntiBribery Policy prohibits employees from making facilitation payments.

Before you offer or accept anything of value, ask an Anti-Bribery approver first and obtain necessary pre-approvals via the Citi Gifts and Entertainment (CGE) system.

Then, if permitted by our policies, be accurate and complete in recording payments or expenses.

## Sanctions

Our decision to do business with various partners must be consistent with applicable laws in all jurisdictions in which we do business.

To comply with sanctions, you must:

- · Understand and abide by the Global Sanctions Policy and applicable U.S. and non-U.S. laws because legal obligations and requirements vary by jurisdiction.
- · Promptly escalate to ICRM Sanctions any concerns you have related to actual or potential attempts by anyone to circumvent sanctions.

## Anti-Boycott Laws

U.S. anti-boycott laws limit the extent to which Citi may comply with boycotts imposed by foreign governments.

Boycott requests can arise in all operations and activities of Citi and can be subtle and indirect. Promptly escalate any request to take action, or any attempt to reach agreement on an action, that would violate U.S. boycott prohibitions to your ICRM Officer.

We are generally prohibited by law from the following actions (and agreements to take such actions) that could further any boycott not approved by the U.S.:

- · Refusing to do business with other persons or companies on the  basis of race, religion, sex, or national origin.
- · Discriminating in employment practices.
- · Furnishing information on the race, religion, gender, or national origin of any U.S. person.
- · Furnishing information about any person's affiliations or business relationships with a boycotted country or with any person blacklisted by a boycotting country.
- · Utilizing letters of credit that contain prohibited boycott provisions.

## Contributing to Our Communities

We are guided by our values to drive positive and meaningful social change through our products and services and our work with clients.  In conjunction with the Citi Foundation and with the time and talent of our workforce, we catalyze innovations for our clients and the communities we serve and drive positive social impact, using our corporate voice to engage in dialogue around the most pressing issues.

To enhance and protect our philanthropic legacy, you must:

- · Follow Citi's non-solicitation policies and ensure that individual giving to charitable organizations is purely voluntary and has no impact on employment or compensation decisions.
- · Not provide or request charitable contributions as a condition of, or in order to influence, a business decision, nor for the benefit of any one individual.
- · Follow due diligence procedures and not deal with inappropriate charitable organizations, such as those funding terrorism or engaging in money laundering, bribery, fraud, or other criminal activity.
- · If you are an approver of charitable contributions and charitable events, review requests to ensure they do not create even the appearance of a conflict or impropriety and that they conform to Citi policies.

<!-- image -->

## Do Your Part

We encourage our workforce to be a part of our shared social purpose and to participate in one or more of the many initiatives Citi supports to benefit the communities in which we live and work.

We also encourage you to make a difference on a personal level. Citi supports your involvement in charitable and political activities on a volunteer basis, but in general, ask that you do so on your own time and at your own expense, making sure your activities are lawful and consistent with our policies.

## Participating in the Political Process

We believe that responsible corporate citizenship means prudent engagement in the political process.

As a global company, Citi employees' roles vary greatly and may involve interactions with government officials or their staff - you are expected to know the restrictions Citi places on such interactions.

While Citi respects your right to participate in personal political activity as an individual, and not as a representative of the company, you must ensure that your individual political activities, as defined in the Activities Involving U.S. Public Officials Standard and Legislative Lobbying and Corporate Political Contributions Involving Non-U.S. Government Officials Standard, are lawful and do not create the appearance of impropriety or a conflict with your Citi role.

The use of Citi time or resources (which include, but is not limited to your company title, company email, company facilities, and contact lists maintained on Citi systems) for your personal political activities is prohibited, unless permissible by law and pre-approved in writing by ICRM and GGA Global Operations Control.

To do so, you must:

- · Know what are considered political activities according to Citi policies, procedures, and standards, and any additional requirements of your country, business, region, and/or function, as these vary by jurisdiction and business line.
- · Always make it clear that your individual political views and actions are your own, and not those of Citi.
- · If you are not a GGA employee, never present yourself as a government-relations representative.

Always Remember

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Did You Know

Political activities may include, but are not limited to:

- · Making corporate or personal political contributions, fundraising, or soliciting political contributions.
- · Volunteering personal services on behalf of a candidate campaigning for public office, a political party committee, or a political action committee. This is particularly sensitive if you are volunteering as part of the officials' leadership team or being in a decision-making role for the political organization.
- · Lobbying or engaging in any outreach to government officials, whether directly or through third parties. Lobbying includes attempts to influence legislation, agency rulemaking, or decisions regarding government contracts.
- · Seeking, accepting, or holding any political office. This includes holding a position on any government board, commission, or other similar organization.

Before engaging in political activities, contact your ICRM Officer or GGA Global Operations Control with any questions regarding the pre-approval requirements and restrictions outlined above.

Our ESRM Policy guides us in evaluating environmental and human rights risks in the projects we finance. The Policy covers a broad scope of financial products and sets standards for how we assess client impact on local communities, climate change, biodiversity, air quality, water quality, Indigenous Peoples, labor, and other environmental and social issues.

## Respecting Human Rights

We are committed to respecting internationally recognized human rights around the world and across our value chain.

We are guided by standards such as those in the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the International Labour Organization's (ILO) Core Conventions regarding forms of child labor, forced labor, freedom of association, the right to organize and bargain collectively, equal pay, and nondiscrimination in the workforce.

The human rights laws of some countries in which we do business differ from some of Citi's global standards. In such circumstances, we seek ways to respect human rights in a manner consistent with those standards, while remaining mindful of the local context.

To promote human rights, we:

- · Prohibit direct financing for activities that are likely to involve human trafficking, modern slavery, the use of child labor, forced labor, or physical punishment and aim to source goods and services only from third parties that have adequate policies and procedures in place to mitigate these risks in their own operations and supply chains.
- · Conduct appropriate, risk-based human rights due diligence to identify and then manage other human rights risks that could arise across our value chain, including in our operations, provision of financial services to customers and in our clients' operations.
- · Strive to do business only with clients and suppliers who share our values with respect to human rights and use our business relationships to share best practices.
