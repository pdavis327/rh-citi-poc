      ## Arbitration
      
      ## Covered Disputes

      You or we may arbitrate any claims, dispute or controversy between you and us arising out of or related to your account(s), a previous related account or our relationship (called "Disputes").

      If arbitration is chosen by any party, neither you nor we will have the right to litigate that Dispute in court or have a jury trial on that Dispute.

      Except as stated below, all Disputes are subject to arbitration no matter what legal theory they are based on or what remedy (damages, or injunctive or declaratory relief) they seek, including claims based on contract, tort (including intentional tort), fraud, agency, your or our negligence, statutory or regulatory provisions, or any other sources of law; claims made as counterclaims, cross-claims, third party claims, interpleaders or otherwise; claims made regarding past, present or future conduct; and claims made independently or with other claims. Disputes include any unresolved claims concerning any services relating to such account, including without limitation, safe deposit box services, wire transfer services, and use of a Citibank® Banking Card or Citibank® Banking Card displaying the MasterCard® Brand Mark. This also includes claims made by or against anyone connected with us or you or claiming through us or you, or by someone making a claim through us or you, such as a joint account owner, account beneficiary, employee, agent, representative, predecessor or successor, heir, assignee, trustee in bankruptcy, or an affiliated/parent/subsidiary company. A party who initiates a proceeding in court may elect arbitration with respect to any dispute advanced in that proceeding by any other party. Disputes include claims made as part of a class action or other representative action, it being expressly understood and agreed to that the arbitration of such claims must proceed on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. Disputes also include claims relating to the enforceability or interpretation of any of these arbitration provisions. Any questions about whether Disputes are subject to arbitration shall be resolved by interpreting this arbitration provision in the broadest way the law will allow it to be enforced.

      We will provide a periodic account statement to you showing all activity for the statement period, all transactions made with your Citibank® Banking Card, all transfers you authorize in advance, and other account information for the statement period. Your periodic statement will include a summary of your linked account balances and an itemized listing of your transactions by date, including information about checks presented against your account, and other notices about your linked accounts. We use postage-paid ordinary postal-mail to send you statements or notices to the postal mail address reflected in our records for the account.

      Regardless of the number of account owners, we only mail to one owner per account. Notification given to any one account owner is considered notification to all account owners and is considered delivered to you on the date we first place the statement or notice in the U.S. mail or the date that the email notifying you that your statement is available on Citibank Online is first sent, regardless of whether or not you receive it.

      If two consecutive statements and/or notices are returned to us for any reason, you agree that we may hold subsequent notices and statements until we receive forwarding information from you. Statements and notices held for you will be deemed delivered to you on the date that they are prepared (for held statements), mailed (for returned statements) or otherwise made available to you. At our discretion, we may destroy mail that is returned to us as determined to be undeliverable. If you have a checking, Checking Plus®, or Checking Plus® (variable rate) line of credit account, you will receive a statement each month and that statement will include information regarding all of your other linked accounts.

      You can arrange to receive separate statements for your linked Citibank accounts by calling CitiPhone Banking® (see the 'Contact Us' section of this Manual for telephone numbers).

      Instead of receiving a paper statement through ordinary postal mail, any signer on an account may elect to enroll in our paperless statement service when you are registered on Citibank Online. If you elect to use the paperless statement service, we will notify you via email of the availability of your statement on Citibank Online. The terms and conditions for the paperless statement service are subject to a separate agreement which you will accept when enrolling in the service and can view at any time on Citibank Online.

      - question:
          How many account owners receive mailed correspondence for an account?

          Regardless of the number of account owners, mail is sent to only one owner per account.
      - question: |
          Can I choose to receive my account statement electronically instead of by mail?
        answer: |

      If you open your account remotely, your Home Branch will generally be the branch where your first account is opened or subsequently transferred. Usually, once your Home Branch is established, additional accounts you open can be assigned to the same Home Branch regardless of the governing law applicable to the additional accounts. If you open your account in a branch, your Home Branch will be the branch where you opened the account. If you notify us of a change of address after your account is opened, it will not affect the Home Branch where your accounts are maintained and it will not affect the governing state law applicable to your existing accounts.

If you do not purchase your checks through us, we may charge a fee for each check that rejects during processing due to poor print quality, or if it fails to meet our specifications.
